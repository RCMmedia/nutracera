						<h4>WHO WE ARE</h4>
						<p>Nutracera is a health and wellness supplement company focused on developing nutraceutical formulations that support the body’s natural healing process.   To ensure the best possible results, we are committed to providing high quality ingredients, without impurities.  Our goal is to provide ingredients that have been proven effective in evidence-based research.</p>
						
						<p>We have taken a special interest in amino acid and micronutrient formulations because of their vital role in bodily functions, as well as their nutrient support for many health related conditions.  Amino acids are absolutely essential for every metabolic process.  Because of their fundamental contributions to the body’s biochemical functioning, amino acids play an important role in the treatment of human disease.  By correcting deficiencies and imbalances, the body can function at optimal performance.</p>
						
						<p>Today’s medicine is simply not working, people are still sick, taking more and more medication, creating a vicious cycle of new symptoms.  Our goal is to educate and bring awareness to alternative approaches for better health.</p>

					<h3 class="section-title">Our Commitment to Quality, Safety, Purity</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Our supplements are 100% pure, no flow agents, no filler agents, no fillers, no artificial colors, no binders, no excipients, which means they are safer, more potent and more absorbable.</li>
						<li>Our quality control measures meet and many times exceed FDA mandates. Additionally, our manufacturing process is certified GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) from NSF - an independent regulatory agency that provides manufacturing and testing standards.</li>
						<li>The raw materials we buy are better in quality.  We only source raw materials from reputable suppliers to ensure potency and safety. Many of the large raw material suppliers in the USA often send “spent” (left over material from the extraction process) material. We test every 			  batch using premium identity testing equipment recommended by NSF.</li>
						<li>Our manufacturing quality controls include, Heavy Metal Analysis, Microbiology Analysis, and Identity Testing.</li>
					</ul>
